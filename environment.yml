# Conda environment for fluvial-particle
# This file contains ONLY dependencies that benefit from conda:
# - Compiled C/C++ libraries (VTK, HDF5)
# - NumPy with MKL optimizations
# All pure Python dependencies come from pyproject.toml via uv

name: fluvial-particle
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  # Python interpreter (constrained to versions with VTK support)
  - python>=3.10,<3.14

  # Package manager (needed for uv to work)

  # Compiled dependencies - better from conda than pip
  - vtk>=9.3.1      # Complex C++ visualization library
  - h5py>=3.7.0     # HDF5 with C bindings
  - numpy>=1.20     # NumPy with MKL optimizations
